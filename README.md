# sr-wiki-downloader

This is a **s**ub**r**eddit **w**iki **d**ownloader. I started working on it
when I realized that the API existed (referenced in this
[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ga2p8y/comment/foxdvju/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
), but before I realized that Reddit will rate limit you if you make more than
10 requests per minute when you're not logged in. That means it's pretty slow to
download a subreddit's wiki, but if you just want to have a copy on your
computer, it works.

# Usage

You can just clone the repo and use go run.

Example:

```
